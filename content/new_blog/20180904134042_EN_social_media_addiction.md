Running in circles, wanting to share every shower thought, every brainfart on twitter to collect likes. This is annoying and I think I'm addicted. I could share this sentence on discord in my two groups and get another round of interactions that give me a short high. Working alone from home seems to make this even more important to me. I blocked everything but facebook today, since one of my tasks at work is to keep an eye on our support groups. It took me 5 minutes to end up in my timeline that I've never checked for ages, clicking on a link to a video that I might have watched. Blocking youtube is one thing, but there are many more video hosts these days and I don't think I can block them all.

It really *fucks* with my time that I need to invest into work, hobbies and sports. My phone is muted, except for phone calls now and lies somewhere I can't see it. Instead of starting to work, I wrote this instead.
