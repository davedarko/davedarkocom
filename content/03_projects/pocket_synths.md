## Pocket synths

First iteration of a sequencer thing, based on the works of todbot, where he transformed an adafruit macropad into a small drone synth with a add-on board. I made a smaller version with reduced parts and integrated modification.

In a later version I added more buttons and LEDs, to get something that looks more like a teenage-engineering pocket operator.
