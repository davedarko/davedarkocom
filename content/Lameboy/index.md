# Assembling The Kit

- Solder the ESP12 and the Switch in manually to prevent heat damage

2. make sure the backlight diodes are properly arranged
3. make sure the esp8266 module can actually be programmed or even pre-program it
4. do not solder it on with the hot air gun
5. mention the bodge wire

I think the arrangement of the power management chip was also a problem
